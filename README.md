# Infrared Object Detection for Autonomous vehicles Using Deep Learning

**Project Overview**

This project explores the development and implementation of an infrared-based object detection system designed for autonomous vehicles. By leveraging deep learning models and thermal imaging data, the project aims to provide a robust, scalable alternative to conventional LiDAR-based systems, particularly for low-light and adverse weather conditions.

**How to use**

- Clone this repo
- Use colab or jupyter notebook to run the code
- Import necessary libraries given in the code
- Run the cell one by one to get the output

Note: 
- There is no need to download any dataset for the code to run.
- Also there is no need to change the code to run in your system
